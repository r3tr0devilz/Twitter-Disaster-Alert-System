This project was created for a Capstone Design Class at Kyungpook National University, Daegu

## Propulsion Background

- To help analyze twitter data for tweets regarding disasters using Natural language processing
- To build a program to make a self learning application to alert people around the vicinity of a disaster

## Objectives and Content

- The program after being developed is expected to be used for quick response by people themselves as quick as possible
- By getting more specific twitter data, the reaction time for a disaster could be made faster than ever. The amount of different ways it can help is innumerable.

## Project Result
- The application after being developed is expected to be used as a service basis, where users pay for the service and be sent personalized disaster response.
- With more data and better training, the NLP program can be improved to be more accurate than ever.
